        <h1>The Falcon deLacy Spaceways Cobra III Manual</h1>
        <p>The Falcon deLacy Spaceways Cobra III is a multi putpose ship.  It can be used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trading cargo between systems</li>
            <li>Mining asteroids</li>
            <li>Law enforcement (bounty hunting)</li>
            <li>Space lane cleaning (scavanging)</li>
            <li>Opportunistic enterprises (piracy - unofficial)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Cockpit</h1>
        <p>The cockpit has the following displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outer Left: A display panel showing:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel: The Cobra III's tank can store enough fuel for a 7 Light Year hyperspace jump.  It is worth
                    noting that no fuel is used when flying within a solar system.</li>
                <li>Temperature: When getting close to a sun the temperature can increase.  Too hot and the ship will burn.</li>
                <li>Altitude: It is unwise to get too close to a sun or planet otherwise the Cobra III will disintegrate.</li>
                <li>Missiles:  One square for each missile, where:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Green is unarmed</li>
                    <li>Yellow is armed and unlocked</li>
                    <li>Red is armed and locked onto a target</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Inner left: Flight modes, These are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>N - Normal space, can navigate and interact with other ships.</li>
                <li>L - Locked Normal Space - Same as nornal space but a ship is releasing a "Lock" field,#
                    this inhibits "Jumping" out of the current location.</li>
                <li>J - Jump space, used for navigating near planets.  This allows for fast travelling near
                   planets, however coming close to any other object will force out of "Jumping" to normal space.</li>
                <li>K - K Jump space.  This is the same as "Jump Space", except it is about ten times faster,
                    This can be initiated some distance away from planets and suns.</li>
                <li>H - Hyper Space - travelling between stars</li>
                <li>W - Witch Space, this is notmal space but away from a solar system.  Should never happen, but
                    there are rumours of existance of aliens that can cause this.</li>
                <li>S - Safe Space, you are near a space station.  Any destructive behaviour here automatically makes
                    you a terrorist and the police are likely to destroy you.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Center: The Braben and Bell 3D radar scanner.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In Normal and Witch Space:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yellow: Another ship</li>
                    <li>Pink: A ship emitting a lock field</li>
                    <li>Blue: A police ship (may be emitting a lock field)</li>
                    <li>White: An asteroid, boulder or rock</li>
                    <li>Pale blue: Space station</li>
                    <li>Red: Missile</li>
                    <li>Green: Flotsam - Cargo or ship wreckage</li>
                    <li>Light green: Escape pod</li>
                    <li>Dark Mauve: Thargoid mothership</li>
                    <li>Light mauve: Thargon slave ship</li>
                    <li>Pale mauve: Dead thargon slave ship</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In Jump Space:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bright yellow: Sun</li>
                    <li>Green: Planet</li>
                    <li>Light blue: Space station</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Inner right: The compass, showing the direction of the space station.  Green dot means it is in front, red dot behind.</li>
            <li>Outer Right: A display panel showing:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Laser temperature: Lasers cannot be fired if too hot.</li>
                <li>Shields: Level of shields.  Once gone the ships energy cells are depleted instead.  This is depleted when lasers hit the ship</li>
                <li>Energy Cell(s): The amount of energy on the capacitors.  If this is depleted the shipblows up.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        </table>
        <h1>Equipment</h1>
        <p>Equipment that can be deployed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fuel: Not really equipment, but required for hyperspace jumps. The value of the amount of fuel equipped represents the
                number of light years that can be travelled.  No fuel is required for "Normal Space" travel, or for "Jump"ing ot "K-Jump"ing.
                Fuel can be bought from all stations, or "scooped" from any sun if a "Fuel Scoop" is fitted.</li>
            <li>Missiles: Up to four of these csn be fitted on a Cobra III.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To Use:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prime/target the missile by pressing the appropriate key (T)</li>
                    <li>Target a ship by manoevering the Cobra III so the cross-hairs are pointinbg to the desired target.</li>
                    <li>You can "Untarget" the missile at any point by pressing the appropriate key (U)</li>
                    <li>To fire the missile press the appropriate key (M).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The missile is an effective weapon.  They are fast so cannot be out-run, and are small so difficult to hit with
                    lasers,  In practice, the only real defense against them is to deploy an "ECM".</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Lasers: These fire compressed light bolts forward, The cross-hairs are useful in manoevering the Conbra III to
                aim the lasers appropriately. When a light bolt hits a ship it weakens it's shield, subsequent hits effects it's integrity.
                Eventually, continuous hits will destroy the ship. Lasers can also be used to fire at asteroids, boulders and rocks  for mining
                Different laser cannons can be fitted:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pulse Laser: Available from Tech level 3 stations and above.
                   Emits a light bolt, the cannon takes a second to recharge down before it can be fired again.</li>
                <li>Beam Laser: Available from Tech Level 4 stations and above.
                    Emits a lower powered light bolt, but the gun can store sufficient energy to emite bp;ts faster
                    for a short period before requiring rechatging.</li>
                <li>Power Laser: Available from Tech Level 10 stations and above. A more powerful charge and bolt.</li>
                <li>Military Laser: Available from Rech Level 10 stations and above. Lasers used by the Police.  These pack a serious punch.</li>
                <li>NOTE: It does bot matter what type of Laser is used for mining, they all have the same effect for that.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Large Cargo Bay: Available from all stations.  Increases the cargo storage capacity from 20 to 35 tonnes.</li>
            <li>ECM System: Electronic Counter Measure. Available from Tech Level 2 stations and above.  When activated it destroys all missiles in range,
                however it uses a fair amount of energy.</li>
            <li>Fuel/Cargo Scoop. Available from Tech Level 5 stations and above. Can be used to collect fuel from suns, or pick
                up cargo canisters, sheets of metals or rocks from space.  To use:
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel: Simply fly close to a sun.  However, be sure you do not get too close, otherwise your situation can get too hot...</li>
                <li>Cargo/Sheets/Rocks: Manoever your Cobra III and fly just above what you want to pick up. Automatic Drone Collectors will
                    then pick the object up.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Escape Pod: Available from Tech Level 6 stations and above.  When equipped they can be deployed by pressing the
                appropriate key (P).  A 3 second count-down will occur (which can be cancelled by pressing the Computer-Off key (D), after
                which you will leave the ship in your escape pod.  You will appear in the local station, and your insurance will have supplied
                you with an identical ship to the one you had.  It will not replace the Escape Pod itself, nor any cargo you may have been carrying.
                A side effect of this is to change your ship's signature, which in effect removes any adverse legal status you had.</li>
            <li>Energy Bomb: Available from Tech Level 7 stations and above.  When the appropriate key is pressed (B) it releases energy that destroys
                all ships in range.  Does not work near stations.</li>
            <li>Extra Energy Unit: Available from Tech Level 8 stations and above.  A must have if you fight, it both doubles the amount of
                "Energy" and "Integrity" you have, but also doubles the speed at which energy is recharged.</li>
            <li>Docking Computers: Available from Tech Level 9 stations and above.  Bored of navigaing to stations to dock?  This does that for you
                while providing you with appropriate soothing music.  To activate pressthe appropriate key (C) when in "Safe" mode (near a station).
                It can be de-activated by pressing the "Computer-Off" key (D).
            <li>Galactic Hyperdrive:  Available from Tech Level 10 stations and above. When equipped, pressing the appropriate key (G) in "Normal Space"
                will initiate a galactic-jump to the next galaxy.  There are 8 galaxies in BELite (jumping from the last one will place you
                back in the first).</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Activites</h1>
        <h2>Flying</h2>
        <p>All activities will consist of flying.  There are three "types" of flying within a solar system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Normal Space: This is simply flying in space, enabling interaction between ships and objects.</li>
            <li>Jump Space: This is activated by pressing the "Jump" key (J). This is super fast flying using "micro-jumping".
                If you jump nearby to another object you will automatically go back to "Normal Space".  You cannot "Jump" if
                there is a "Lock" field being emitted by someone.</li>
            <li>K-Jump Space: This is activated by pressing the "K-Jump" key (K).  This cannot be activated if near a sun or planet.
                This is like "Jump Space" except it is about ten times faster.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Flying in higher security systems reduces the chance of coming across pirates, and increases the chance of police appearing when
           trouble occurs (someone is hit by a laser).  However, higher security means more tax is applied to both the purchase and
           sale price of cargo in stations.</p>

        <h2>Trading</h2>
        <p>Trading consists of buying cargo than are "In supply" from one station, and selling them to where they are "in demand" to another station.
           The "Info" screen in the navigation screens say what is in supply and demand for each system.</p>
        <p>Pirates will try and intercept you. Trading in the lower security systems is not recomeended unless you are suitably armed and equipped.</p>

        <h2>Bounty Hunting</h2>
        <p>Targetting a ship with the "Missile Target" mechanism will tell you if there is a bounty on the ship, even if you have no missiles
           (remember to "Untarget" afterwards).  If there is a bounty destroying the ship will earn you that bounty.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that destroying ships
           with a bounty is not illegal and will not effect your legal status, however, even accidently shooting at and hitting clean ships do.</p>

        <h2>Mining</h2>
        <p>To mine you need a laser (any type will do, it makes no difference to mining), and a Cargo/Fuel scoop.</p>
        <p>To mine:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fly until you come across an astreroid (appears as white in the Normal Space scanner).</li>
            <li>Continuously fire the laser into the asteroid until a boulder is freed (takes about a minute).</li>
            <li>Wait for the boulder to drift a reasonable distance from the asteroid</li>
            <li>Fire the laser at the boulder, and it will "blow up" and some rocks will renmian.</li>
            <li>Pick up the rocks by flying just above them.  Most are minerals, but there are some other metals there sometimes.</li>
            <li>When all rocks are collected, fire into the asteroid continuously again to release another boulder.</li>
            <li>And so on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Asteroids appear more on poor agricultural economies than rich industrial.  Some asteroids have hermits in them (they can be identified
           by pink panels on the asteroid itself).  Mining threse have richer pickings, but you may have an issue with the hermit(s) who live there.</p>

        <h2>Scavanging</h2>
        <p>Occasionally you will come across cargo canisters and/or canisters, often when the police have destroyed a pirate.</p>
        <p>Should you have a Fuel/Cargo Scoop attached you can collect these, if you have spacre cargo space, by manoevering the Cobta III
           and flying just above the canisters or panels.  When this is doen they will appear in your cargo.</p>
        <p>These can then be sold at any station.</p>

        <h2>Piracy</h2>
        <p>Simple! Shoot ships and scavange the cargo.</p>
        <p>But.... Shooting legally "clean" ships can attract the Police, who will shoot you.  So best to do this in systems with no security (Anarchy systems).</p>
        <p>Also, shooting "clean" ships will mean you attract a bounty, which means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The police will no longer come to your assistance if someone shoots at you.</li>
            <li>Bounty hunters, that previously would ignore you, will try and destroy you for the bounty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your bounty decreases each time you jump in hyperspace.  Using an escape pod, or using the Glactic Hyperspace, will clear your legal status
           completely.</p>
