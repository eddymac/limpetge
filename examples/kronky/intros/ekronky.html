<p>The Kronky Energy Unit</p>
<div class="pictures"><img class="inpict" src = "intros/ekronky.png" alt="Kronky Energy Unit"/></div>
<p>If you "pick up" one of these (by going to it and pressing "E"), the number of Kronkys you can have on the go increases by one.
   So therefore after picking this up, you can have two Kronkys doing things at the same time.  This will last for that level.</p>
<p>You can still only "Record" one Kronky at a time (pressing "I"), however, normally you will need to wait for the Kronky to
   complete (or die) before doing so again. With an extra "Energy Unit" though, you can press "I" before that and "Record" actions while
   the Kronky is still active. Then when you next "Activate Time Travel" (pressing "P") you will have two Kronkys active.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is that once you have "charged" yourself with an Energy Unit, you cannot "charge" yourself again
   with the same unit (even if you go back in time).  Sorry. </p>
