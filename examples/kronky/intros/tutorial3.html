<p>The way the Kronky "go back in time" works is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You initialise the alternative Kronky.  It is initialised just in front of you.  You can consider this as your "future self".</li>
<li>You can then do a number things as per normal, pick up, go places, etc..</li>
<li>When you "Activate" the Kronky, you go back in time to the point you initialised it (step 1).
 You then "become" the Kronky, and the Kronky "becomes" you when you initialised it, and it performs all the actions you did in step 2. You can now consider the Kronky as your past self.</li>
<li>You can then do other things while the Kronky did what you did.</li>
</ol>
<p>You cannot initialise another Kronky until it has performed all its actions (step 3), or has died.</p>
