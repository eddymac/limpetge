<p>To complete this task, you need to open the door to the Exit before taking the flower there.</p>
<p>To open the door, you simply "unlock" it by placing the correct key in the appropriate key hole.  This is done by picking up the key and taking it to the there.</p>
<div class="pictures"><img class="inpict" src = "intros/dkeyt.png" alt="Key"/> <span class="inpict">-&gt;</span> <img class="inpict" src="intros/dkeyholet.png" alt="Key Hole"/></div>
<p>Once unlocked and open, you then can take the flower to the exit.</p>
<p>Some more controls, if you want to drop (or place) an object press "Q".  If you want to throw it (away), press "C".  You do not have to either of those in this level thoough, I am just saying....</p>
<p>Therefore....:</p>
<table>
<tr><td class="keyname">E</td><td>Pick up an object</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">Q</td><td>Place or drop an object</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">C</td><td>Throw an object</td></tr>
</table>
