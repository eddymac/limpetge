<p>Restricted Platform</p>

<p>In order to place (or drop) an object, the floor needs to be specially treated so it can "hover" the way it does.
Due to laziness of programmers not all floors are so treated, these are then assigned as "Restricted".</p>
<p>On these platforms you (an the Kronky) can walk on it, you simply cannot "drop" or "place" any object on them.</p>
