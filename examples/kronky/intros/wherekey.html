<p>If you travel back in time and see yourself then, there are lots of things you could do I suppose, these could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid yourself so you do not create a paradox...</li>
<li>Tell yourself wonders of the future so you do not make the mistakes you did...</li>
<li>Shake yourself warmly by the hand and say what a brilliant person you are...</li>
<li>Or you could just simply steal something from yourself.</li>
</ul>
