<h1 id="introheader"></h1>
<p>Well done for making it this far (unless you "jumped" ahead).  Just a couple more generic things before these introductions are complete.</p>
<p>First - you can "Save" a point by pressing "ENTER", and restore it by pressing "BACKSPACE".
   You can only "save" one point at a time, and it is volatile in that it goes if you leave the level. 
   It is useful if you are about to attempt anything that may fail.</p>
<p>The other is that you can "Fast Forward" time by pressing "G".  This will speed things up by about a factor of five, and is useful if you need to wait for anything.</p>
<p>Also, you can quit the level by pressing "ESCAPE" should you get trapped somewhere.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of the levels.</p>

<p>A summary of keys:</p>
<table>
<tr><td class="keyname">ENTER</td><td>Create save point (overwriting the last one)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">BACKSPACE</td><td>Restore save point</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">ESCAPE</td><td>Quit level</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">G</td><td>Fast forward time</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Yours ever...</p>
