<p>The Zip wire...</p>
<div class="pictures"><img class="inpict" src = "intros/wire.png" alt="Wire fence"/></div>
<p>A wire fence will stop you (and the Kronky), however, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Steal" (or "take") objects through them.</li>
<li>Drop an object just on the other side of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to "steal", or "take" an object from a Kronky:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go up to a Kronky carrying one, stand in front of it.</li>
<li>Press "E" (Pick up).</li>
</ol>
<p>Needless to say, a Kronky can steal from you.</p>
<p>Note: There are two ways you can solve this puzzle...</p>
<p>One method involves, at some point, placing the Flower back on the Flower Stand (or Plinth) where you got it from.  The easiest way to do this is to walk towards the stand (while holding the Flower) pressing the "Q" key (Drop / Place),  or simply throwing it away.</p>
<p>The other method does not.</p>
<p>Key:</p>
