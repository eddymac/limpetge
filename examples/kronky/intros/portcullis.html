<p>The Portcullis Gate</p>
<div class="pictures"><img class="inpict" src = "intros/portcullis.png" alt="Portcullis gate"/></div>
<p>A Portcullis gate.  Does not have a key as such, but in order to open it you need to "pull" on an appropriate rope....</p>
<p>To operate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the rope - that is the stripy thing hanging down from the beam.</li>
<li>"Pick it up" (by pressing "E"), this will open the gate</li>
<li>While "holding the rope, you cannot move.</li>
<li>Release the rope by "dropping" it (pressing "Q"), the gate will close and you can move again.</li>
<li>If anything was in the gateway when it is shut it will be crushed horribly and destroyed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keys:</p>
<table>
<tr><td class="keyname">E</td><td>(On the rope) Open the gate (same as pick up)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">Q</td><td>(On the rope) Close the gate (same as drop / place)</td></tr>
</table>
