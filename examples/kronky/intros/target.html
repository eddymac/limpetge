<p>It is possible to throw an object you have picked up at another.  This is done by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Going to where you want to throw the object you are carrying.</li>
<li>Turn ("&lt;" and "&gt;" keys) so you are pointing in the direction you want the object to go.</li>
<li>Possibly strafing may be useful too ("A" and "D" keys).</li>
<li>Press "C" to throw what you are carrying."</li>
</ol>
<p>A tip for this puzzle, and manoeuvering to near an edge of a platform, is to look down - using the "M" key.  You can look up again - by using the "K" key.</p>
<p>Relevant (new) keys:</p>
<table>
<tr><td class="keyname">M</td><td>Look Down</td></tr>
<tr><td class="keyname">K</td><td>Look Up</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>And of course...
<tr><td class="keyname">C</td><td>Throw (or chuck) the thing.</td></tr>
</table>
