/*
ShaderSimple : A "SIMPLE" shader 

A very simple shader.  Just uses a directional light and ambient one.

doInitBuffer(structure)
    structure.args:

        One of:
            texture: url string
            rawrtexture: loaded texture
            color: vec4 color
            colors: array of vec4 colors

        As well as the standard arrays

doDraw(buffer, position, control)
    lScene.ambienLight  - A vec3 representing the ambient light
    lScene.directionalLightColor
                        - A vec3 representing the direcrtional light color
                          (the sun).
    lSScene.directionalVector
                        - The direction of the light taking into consideration
                          where the camera is pointing.  LimpetGE updates this
                          automatically if the direction is set using the
                          "lScene.lDirectionalVector" ("vec3") is set.
