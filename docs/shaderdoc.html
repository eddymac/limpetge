<h1>LimpetGE Shader Reference</h1>
<div>The LimpetGE shader reference manual.  This is not about actually wrining shaders, but how to incorporate them 
     into the LimpetGE framework.</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Each "shader" has it's information contained in a constant javascript object.  Each contains the following properties:</pi>
<table>
    <tr><td>key</td><td>A unique key number for the shader. It is usually (re)generated when compiling the script.</tr></td>
    <tr><td>vertexSource</td><td>The Vertex Shader source code</td>
    <tr><td>fragSource</td><td>The fragment shader source code</td>
    <tr><td>compile()</td><td>Compiles the Fragment and Vertex programs. It also "binds" the shader's uniform and attribute locations, usually
            into a "sub-object" called "locations" on the shader object.  Called once when initialising the LimpetGE environment (in "lInit()")</td><.tr>
    <tr><td>doInitBuffer(structure)</td><td>A function, that has a structure as it's argument.  It assembles the OpenGL buffers from the Points, Normals and Texture coordinates arrays.
                    These are then stored in the "buffer" property (also a Javascript object) on the structue class.  Related information to the buffers are stored there too.  Called for each structure
                    when structures are complete.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>useProgram()</td><td>A function, when called, is a wrapper around the OpenGL "useProgram" program.  Called once in each frame.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>useBuffer(buffer)</td><td>Takes the structure's buffer as the argument.  It binds the buffer information to the uniform shader locations. It is called once per frame per structure.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>doDraw(buffer, position, control)</td><td>Takes the structure's buffer, a "mat4" position and a game object's control as the arguments.  This binds any "last minute" uniform or attributes,
            and does OpenGL's "drawElements(....)" routine (or equivalent).  Called once per frame per object.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There is a global variable that needs to exist and be set as well:</p>

<div>lShader_objects - This is an array of shaders used, in the order there objects are to be drawn.</div>

<hr />

<h4>Best way to include a new shader in LimpetGE</h4>

<p>Take one, copy it, and modify it.</p>

<hr />
<h3>The vertesSource and fragSource properties</h3>

<p>These are the "Fragment Shader" and "Vertex Shader" sources as strings.   I will not go into these, there is resource on the web how to write these.</p>

<h3>The compile() function</h3>

<p>This is esponsible for compiling the shaders and binding the uniform and attribute locations. </p>

<p>To compile, there is a LimpetGE helper function "lInitShaderProgram(fragmentSource, vertexSource)". The definition of this is:</p>

<table>
    <tr><td>lInitShaderProgram(vertexSource, fragmentSource)</td><td colspan=2>Compile the shader sources</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>vertexSource</td><td>The source for the vertex shader</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>fragmentSource</td><td>The source for the fragment shader</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td colspan=2>Returns the compiled program.  Usually stored in the "shader" property of the shader object.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The locations are normally bound to variables in a created object, which is then stored in the "locations" property of the Shader Object.</p>

<p>To understand this, it is probably best to look at the shader objects supplied.</p>

<hr />

<h3>The doInitBuffer(structure) function</h3>

<p>This taks the structure (as created by "new LStructureDef") as the argument.  It is called uring the "lStructureSetup()" function, which is
   automatically called for all structures that have not had this called before.  That function is called in the creation of the "Scene" instance is
    created: a class that is derived from the "LBase" class.  If for some reason it is to be "re-initialised" he user can set the "compiled" property
    on the structure to "false", and call "lStructureSetup()" again, or create a new "Scene".</p>

<p>The relevant property arrays, and associated information, supplied by the structure are: </p>

<table>
    <tr><td>structure.args</td><td>The "object named arguments" passed to the LStructureDef constructor when created.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>structure.pointsArray</td><td>An array containing the coordinates of the vertices (just the x, y and z, no w).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>structure.normalsArray</td><td>An array containing the corresponding normals for the vertices (x, y and z).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>structure.textureCoords</td><td>An array of The coordinates in the texture collage supplied (u, v) - values between 0.0 and 1.0.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>structure.pointsIndex</td><td>An array of the indexes to be used as the controlling OpenGL "drawElements" function.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>structure.numentries</td><td>This is the length of the "pointsIndex" array.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>While processing what is passed in "args", the following from the LimpetGE javascript may be useful:</p>

<table>
    <tr><td>lLoadTexture(url)</td><td colspan=2>Load a texture from a URL and return it</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>url</td><td>The URL of the appropriate image to load.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>lLoadColor(color)</td><td colspan=2>Create a texture containing a one pixel image and return it</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>color</td><td>The color ("vec4") to use.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>lLoadColors(colors, width, height)</td><td colspan=2>Create a texture containing a (width * height) pixel image and return it</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>colors</td><td>An array of "vec4" arrays representing colors.  The number of these should equal width multiplied by height. </td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>width</td><td>The width in pixels of the image</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>height</td><td>The height in pixels of the image.  This is usually one, and nothing is achieved by using
                anything else.  The "ltextureColor" helper function assumes this.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It is at this point you can pass alternative textures (a more bloody face as an entity gets more injured, etc), and the such.</p>

<p>The arrays need to go through the "bind" process, a reference stored on an object that is stored in the "buffer" property of the structure.</p>
        
<p>Again, to understand this, it is probably best to look at the shader objects supplied.</p>

<hr />

<h3>The useProgram() function</h3>
<p>A wrapper to the OpenGL's "useProgram(shader)" function. The "shader" program is usually in the "shader" property of the object, if not, it
   is where you put it in the "compile()" function.</p>

<hr />

<h3>The useBuffer(buffer) function</h3>

<p>This is called once per frame per structure.  It performs the "bind" process of the arrays in the "buffer" (created in "doInitBuffer(...)" above) onto
   the OpenGL "locations" (created in the "compile()" function above).  It also binds any uniform locations, remembering there is access to the "Scene" objects
   (using the global "lScene" variable that stores a reference to it).</p>

<p>Again, to understand this, it is probably best to look at the shader objects supplied.</p>
<hr />
    
<h3>The doDraw(buffer, position, control) function</h3>

<p>This draws the objecit, the arguments: </p>
<table>
    <tr><td>buffer</td><td>The "buffer" property of structure</td></tr>
    <tr><td>position</td><td>The scene transformation position ("mat4") where this object is to be placed.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>control</td><td>An object that is the "control" of the object, as defined when creating the "new LObject(structure, control)" instance.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This functions needs to call the OpenGL "drawElements(...)" function (or whatever), and do the "last minute" proparations for that (binding the scene position and the like).</p>

<p>Again, with dnger to repeating myself, to understand this, it is probably best to look at the shader objects supplied.</p>

<hr />

<h3>the lShader_objects array</h3>

<p>This is a constant global array.  It lists the shader object references in the order they are to be drawn (transparent ones last).</p>
